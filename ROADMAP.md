# Roadmap

weir is well past its original v0.1 target — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for
what's shipped (adapters, poller, router, retainer, OPML, search, feed archaeology
+ recovery drip, watch-affinity, PWA, full-content extraction, mouse UX). The
canonical design intent is [SPEC.md](SPEC.md); this file is the **forward plan**.
Nothing here is committed scope — it's the candidate list, roughly ordered.

## Near term — small UX / polish

- **Views over sources (smart-folders).** Saved filters over feeds and items —
  by folder, feed-health, or watch-affinity; saved item searches as `#views`
  (SPEC §6). The rail's "Routed" section is the seed of this.
- ~~**Feed favicons** in the rail for visual scanning.~~ ✅ Shipped 2026-05-31 —
  lazy/polite fetch via the bridge, cached as `data:` URLs, deterministic letter
  monogram fallback.
  - ~~**Follow-up: `<link rel="icon">` fallback.**~~ ✅ Shipped 2026-05-31 — feeds
    that miss `<origin>/favicon.ico` now get a second pass: fetch the home page,
    `parseIconLinks` extracts `icon`/`shortcut icon`/`apple-touch-icon` hrefs
    (ranked SVG → ~32px → rest), and the best one or two are fetched. Same
    politeness throttle; only for feeds the `.ico` missed.
- ~~**Density toggle** (compact ↔ comfortable item rows).~~ ✅ Shipped 2026-05-31.
- ~~**Edit feed URL.**~~ ✅ Shipped 2026-05-31 — the feed context menu's
  "Edit feed…" opens a dialog (name, URL, folder, images, full-text, **+ "remove
  stored items on save"**). Changing the URL resets `next_poll_at` and re-polls
  the new source immediately; `clearFeedItems` drops the old items (saved-exempt,
  no tombstone). Motivated by a real hijack: the abandoned FeedBurner proxy
  `feeds.feedburner.com/PythonSoftwareFoundationNews` now serves SEO spam instead
  of `pyfound.blogspot.com` — now a one-dialog fix.
- **Manual reorder within a folder.** Regroup (move-to-folder) + rename already
  exist via the feed context menu; this adds a manual `feed.order` to override the
  affinity/name sort. (Drag deferred — context-menu "move up/down" likely enough.)
- **Manual prune control.** Retention is archive-only and off by default; add a
  "prune/archive expired now" action for when you do want a sweep.

## Medium

- ~~**Affinity-driven poll cadence.**~~ ✅ Shipped 2026-05-31 (`pollIntervalFor`
  in `poller.js`). Scales each feed's interval off the baseline by watch-affinity,
  observed cadence (≥3wk history guard), and health backoff; clamped 30 min–1 wk;
  `adaptive_polling` toggle (on by default). Follow-up: surface the effective
  interval per feed (edit dialog / tooltip); fold in time-of-day patterns.
- **Source-health view** (SPEC §9 v0.3): per-feed history, last-known-good,
  surfacing slow/failing feeds; auto-archive after a failure threshold.
- ~~**Feed-hijack / drift detection.**~~ ✅ Shipped 2026-05-31 (`health.js`).
  `assessFeed` scores each feed from its stored items into **suspect** (hijack/
  drift), **stale** (long-quiet), **failing** (poller can't fetch), or ok.
  Suspect needs ≥2 independent tells (generic-`admin` author collapse +2, links
  uniformly off the feed's own host +1, a repeated brand token across titles +1)
  so non-English feeds and link blogs don't false-flag. Flagged feeds get a rail
  badge + class; a status-bar chip (`⚠ N suspect · N stale`) opens a **feed-health
  overlay** listing each with its reasons and one-click *Edit feed* / *Open site*
  / *Show items*. Follow-ups: memoize per-feed health (currently recomputed each
  rail render); a dedicated health filter-view; richer signals (language-shift vs.
  the feed's own history, near-duplicate-body bursts); auto-suggest the native
  source when a FeedBurner proxy goes suspect.
- **Bridge v0.2 conditional GETs.** When `@gcu/bridge` ships ETag/If-Modified-Since
  caching, wire `etag`/`last_modified` (already on the Feed model) for polite polls.
- **Search v0.2.** Swap the cursor scan for a MiniSearch/`@gcu/librarian` inverted
  index over `search_text` (ranked, fuzzy); index full-content text too.
- **Save-to-glass.** Auditable Works interop — `BroadcastChannel('gcu-handoff')`
  export with an FSA-markdown fallback (SPEC §7).

## Larger / research

- **More adapters:** `scrape` (public-page change tracking → `track` items), arXiv,
  GitHub, Mastodon, Bluesky.
- **Storage tiers.** OPFS/FSA content backend (the store is already backend-agnostic
  — mostly a config swap); a **cold-store** tier that offloads archived items out
  of the hot in-memory index — still never deleting ([[weir-never-delete]]).
- **Save-Page-Now.** Proactively archive live feeds to the Internet Archive (uses
  the IA keys already in Settings) so future [feed archaeology](CHANGELOG.md)
  always has snapshots. Plus link-rot recovery (dead item URL → archived page).
- **webmcp.** Vendor `../auditable/ext/webmcp` so Claude can drive weir directly —
  curation, triage, bulk ops.
- **Sync** (the open question, SPEC §10). Lean on the FSA archive dir +
  syncthing/rclone, or a `@gcu/pointer`/Trystero CRDT for read-state. Deferred
  until the need is real (multi-device).

## Known limitations / tech debt

- The full-content **extractor** (heuristic readability) and the **sanitizer**
  (regex for feeds, DOM for extraction) are pragmatic, not bulletproof —
  acceptable for a single-user local tool; revisit before any shared scenario.
- **Feed-health thresholds** are guesses (SPEC §10) — tune against real behavior.
- The rail/stream render eagerly; very large sets (1000+) lean on folder-collapse
  + the 300-row cap. Virtualize if it ever feels heavy.
- The built `index.html` is committed (deterministic build) for GitHub Pages.
- **Cleanup from the 2026-05-31 code review** (bugs fixed; these are the
  refactors): the six overlay open/close pairs + Esc id-list want one overlay
  mechanism; image-suppression lives in two places (`sanitize.js` regex +
  `extract.js` DOM) — unify into one `suppressImages` helper; feed-menu toggles
  mutate-then-`putFeed` — add `store.updateFeed(id, patch)`; item-action verbs are
  spelled out in three render sites (hover toolbar, reader footer, context menu) —
  drive from one descriptor list. (`reflectItem` already unified row updates.)
