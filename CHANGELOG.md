# Changelog

All notable changes to `@gcu/weir` are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is described in
[SPEC.md §9](SPEC.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Storage layer + bridge probe — 2026-05-30

- VFS-backed store (`src/js/store/`): `schema.js` (Item/Feed/Tag/Settings, retention
  TTLs, `search_text`/`expires_at` derivation, fs-safe keys) and the `Store` class.
  Single store, backend-swappable (IndexedDB default; FSA/OPFS/memory). Queryable
  index lives in memory, hydrated at startup from compact per-feed NDJSON shards;
  item HTML content is lazy per-item files. Dedup on insert updates mutable fields
  only and an `archived_index` tombstone blocks resurrection (SPEC §5). Cursor-scan
  substring search over `search_text` (SPEC §6 v0.1).
- Vendored the `@gcu/bridge` page client (CC0); a non-blocking connectivity probe
  reports bridge presence/version in the shell status bar.
- Tooling: `tools/smoke-store.mjs` (insert/dedup/prune/rehydrate, run in node),
  `tools/serve.mjs` dev server (`npm run serve`), `npm run smoke`.

### Foundation decisions — 2026-05-30

Pre-implementation direction set while surveying the sibling `auditable` toolkit
for reusable parts. No reader code yet; this records settled choices.

- **License changed from CC0 to MIT** © Arthur Endlein Correia, to match
  `@gcu/vfs` and the rest of the auditable toolkit weir vendors from.
- **Vendoring foundation from `@gcu/auditable`** (`vendor/`): `@gcu/vfs` (storage
  backbone), Switchboard design tokens + Barlow/Space Mono fonts. Provenance and
  per-item licenses tracked in `vendor/PROVENANCE.md`.
- **Storage built on VFS**, single store with a selectable backend (IndexedDB by
  default, File System Access when the user picks a directory) so the entire state
  — content and index — can live on the real filesystem. Collapses the planned
  IDB→OPFS→FSA stages (SPEC §5) into a backend swap. Queryable index becomes an
  in-memory index hydrated from a packed file rather than IDB-native compound
  indexes. (Deviation from SPEC §5 literal v0.1; noted in CLAUDE.md.)
- **Design palette = canonical Switchboard `--sw-*`** (muted, accessibility-tuned
  basalt), superseding the mockup's brighter `--basalt-*`/`--a-*` tokens; mockup to
  be reconciled.

### v0.1 draft — 2026-05-23

Design phase. No implementation yet.

- Initial specification ([SPEC.md](SPEC.md)) covering architecture, data model
  (Item, Feed, Tag, Settings), adapters (`feed`, `youtube`, `scrape`), the
  two-pane UI and interaction model, the three-stage storage strategy
  (IndexedDB → OPFS → File System Access), retention rules, JS routing rules,
  views, two-layer search, and `@gcu/bridge` / Auditable Works integration.
- Interactive UI mockup ([examples/weir-mockup.html](examples/weir-mockup.html)).
- Scope, non-goals, and roadmap through v1.0 defined.

Build target for the first implemented release is SPEC.md §9 "v0.1 — Minimum
useful reader."
