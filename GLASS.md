| **Package** | `@gcu/glass` |
| **Home implementation** | `@gcu/weir` — glass *is* what weir becomes when its archive is cataloged |
| **Format license** | CC0 — anyone may implement the catalog/facet/index format |

## 1. Thesis

Most knowledge tooling sits at one of two poles; glass rejects both:

- **Manual graphs (Obsidian).** You maintain the structure by hand-typing links.
  It is only as good as your discipline and decays the moment you stop tending it.
- **Embed-and-pray (every LLM-era tool).** Organization is delegated to an opaque
  vector space. Synonyms, homonyms, broader/narrower relations fail *silently* —
  plausible neighbors, no way to audit why.

Glass takes the third, older position from library science: **a cataloger
continuously processes inputs into a proper library** — faceted classification,
controlled vocabulary, Dublin Core metadata, a typed relation graph — maintained
by an LLM but **fully inspectable and correctable by a human.** Obsidian gives you
a graph you maintain by hand; embeddings give you a graph nobody can read; glass
gives you a library that maintains itself *and shows its work.*

### 1.1 Dumb pipes, smart service (the architectural inversion)

The opposite of RAG. RAG puts a smart pipeline in front of dumb retrieval. Glass
makes **the tooling a clean, deterministic interface to structured data, and uses
the LLM as a constrained *service*** — not an autonomous agent. Search, get,
browse, and vocabulary lookups are boring functions. Cataloging is a *bounded
call*: read one document → emit one catalog card (structured JSON) → done. The
intelligence is real but it is on a leash: it produces auditable records, never
drives the system. (Agentic use — your Claude *triggering* cataloging or running
reference queries over weir — lives on top via **webmcp**, §13; it is not the core.)

### 1.2 Why weir is the home

weir already *is* the hard part of a knowledge base: a durable, never-deleted,
full-content, deduped, FSA-mountable archive of timestamped material, with a
type/tag/provenance model that is **already a single-axis proto-facet scheme.**
The material is already here. Asking the user to "export to a separate notes app"
was always friction. So glass is not a sibling weir hands off to — **glass is weir
finishing its own model:** the archive, cataloged.

The line between *reading*, *taking a note*, and *adding to the library*
disappears. You read a feed item or write a note; the cataloger picks it up; it is
in the library. No separate ingest step.

---

## 2. LIS foundations

Glass treats a humanities discipline as an engineering dependency:

- **Faceted classification (Ranganathan).** Multiple independent axes, not one
  enumerative tree. A paper on the geostatistics of iron grade in itabirite is not
  filed under geostatistics *or* mining — it is `domain:[geostatistics, mining]`,
  `entity:[kriging, itabirite, iron-ore]`, `process:[estimation]` *simultaneously.*
  Interdisciplinary material stops being a filing problem and becomes an
  intersection query. This is why the catalog stays coherent as the collection
  grows in unexpected directions.
- **Dublin Core.** The metadata baseline (title, creator, date, type, identifier,
  source, description, language). Stable, boring, interoperable.
- **Vocabulary control / thesaurus.** Explicit broader/narrower/related/use-for
  relations between terms (§7). Exactly where embeddings fail silently and a
  thesaurus fails *loudly* — and therefore correctably.
- **The reference interview.** Figuring out what someone *needs* vs. what they
  *asked* — maps onto query decomposition (§8).

### 2.1 Decides vs. proposes — the boundary that replaces "no statistics" **[principle]**

Glass began partly as a reaction to RAG-as-sold (cosine similarity dressed as
understanding; synthesis with no provenance). That reflex over-corrected into a
blanket suspicion of *anything* statistical — but glass **isn't a RAG** (there is
no generation-over-retrieval; it is a *catalog*), and the techniques RAG borrowed —
embeddings, clustering, dimensionality reduction, IR ranking — are a century of
information science, not the pathogen. (Full-text search already uses **BM25** —
pure statistical IR — and nobody flinched. The line was never really "no
statistics.")

So the governing boundary is **not symbolic vs. statistical. It is *decides* vs.
*proposes*:**

- A classification **decision** — what term a card carries, what BT/NT/RT relation
  holds, where something is filed — stays **declared, auditable, and
  human-ratifiable.** This is the *only* place the "fails loudly" discipline must
  hold, because it is the only place trust and correctability live.
- Everything **upstream** of the decision — signals, suggestions, rankings,
  similarity, maps — **may be as fuzzy as it likes**, because a human (or a declared
  rule) ratifies before it becomes catalog truth.

This is what lets statistical methods back in without re-importing the mush:
embeddings that *propose* a merge or a possibly-related pair (the **vocabulary
doctor**), clustering over facet co-occurrence (the emergent graph's neighborhoods,
§10), **UMAP** that *draws* a map (a lens — casts no vote), relevance feedback from
read/saved to tune ranking, and the `needs_review` queue — which is already
**active learning**. Each *suggests*; a person or rule *ratifies*; nothing files
itself.

The discipline was right about **authority**, not **utility**. Keep the wall
exactly at the decision boundary; open every door upstream of it — *reasoned
boundaries, not reflexes* (a blanket "reject statistics" would be its own
absolutism; a blanket "embrace everything" walks back into the mush).

---

## 3. Where it lives in weir's store

weir's VFS already holds `/feeds`, `/items` (metadata shards), `/content`
(lazy bodies). Glass adds three trees; the layout is identical on every backend
(IDB / FSA folder), so it travels with the FSA mount:

```
/catalog/<glass_id>.json     # one catalog card per cataloged item. SOURCE OF TRUTH.
/schema/facets.json          # facet definitions, vocabulary types, scope notes
/schema/vocab/<facet>.json   # controlled terms + definitions + thesaurus per facet
/glass-index/                # DERIVED from /catalog — safe to delete + rebuild
    master.json              # flat {glass_id, title, form, confidence, date} — one-pass scannable
    facets/<facet>.json      # inverted: term → [glass_id, …]  (fast intersection)
    vocabulary.json          # every term + occurrence counts (coin-check + suggest)
    relations.json           # the typed-edge graph
```

The **documents** are weir's existing items: a fetched item's body is its
`/content/<…>.html`; a note's body is markdown (§9). The catalog card *references*
the weir item id; it never copies the body. One rule each:

- **`/catalog/` is metadata** — the single source of truth for classification.
- **`/glass-index/` is cache** — a pure function of `/catalog/`; rebuild anytime.
- **`/schema/` is config** — editing a scope note here changes how new material
  is classified. The closest thing glass has to policy.

### 3.1 Pairing
The card carries `document_ref` → the weir item id; the item record carries its
`glass_id` (a new optional field). Either side finds the other; a loose card is
never orphaned, a loose item is self-identifying.

---

## 4. The catalog card **[settled, modulo facet scheme]**

One JSON file per cataloged document. Three blocks: Dublin Core, facets, glass meta.

```json
{
  "dublin_core": {
    "title": "Ordinary vs. Simple Kriging of Fe Grade in Itabirite",
    "creator": ["Silva, M.A.", "Torres, R."],
    "date": "2023-06-15",
    "type": "article",
    "language": "en",
    "identifier": "doi:10.xxxx/xxxxx",
    "source": "Mathematical Geosciences v.55(3)",
    "description": "Compares OK and SK estimators for iron grade in itabirite-hosted profiles of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero; SK outperforms where a strong grade trend is present."
  },
  "facets": {
    "domain":   ["geostatistics", "mining"],
    "entity":   ["kriging", "itabirite", "iron-ore"],
    "process":  ["estimation", "comparison"],
    "method":   ["ordinary-kriging", "simple-kriging"],
    "scale":    ["deposit"],
    "form":     ["article"],
    "provenance": ["peer-reviewed"],
    "spatial":  ["Quadrilátero Ferrífero"],
    "temporal": ["2023"]
  },
  "glass": {
    "glass_id": "glass-20260404-001",
    "document_ref": "arxiv:2306.xxxxx",
    "cataloged": "2026-04-04",
    "cataloger": "ollama:llama-3.3 | stage0-rules",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "needs_review": false,
    "related": [
      { "type": "extends",     "target": "glass-20260312-004" },
      { "type": "contradicts", "target": "glass-20260401-012" }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Every facet value is an array** — a document may sit at several positions on
  any axis; nothing forces a single pick.
- `confidence` lets the cataloger flag its own uncertainty; `needs_review: true`
  drops the card into a human review queue rather than guessing silently.
- `related` uses **typed** edges (`extends` / `contradicts` / `supports` /
  `supersedes`), not undifferentiated "see also" — this is what makes
  citation-chain traversal meaningful.
- `cataloger` records *who* cataloged it (a model id, or `stage0-rules` for the
  deterministic pass) — provenance of the classification itself.

### 4.1 Work-grouping (FRBR) — dedup the never-delete way **[designed]**

weir's current dedup is **discard-on-collision** (same id → drop the newcomer). FRBR
inverts it: **keep every copy, group what is the same.** The same content arrives
through many pipes — wire stories carried by ten outlets, cross-posted blogs (an
Akamai post syndicated through the *Linode* feed is a real case in the corpus),
arXiv-then-published papers, re-uploaded videos. FRBR's four levels name the
distinction:

| FRBR | weir |
|---|---|
| **Work** — the abstract content | the story / idea ("the MS-RPC writeup") |
| **Expression** — a version | preprint vs published; 720p vs 4K; a translation |
| **Manifestation** — a publication | *this* item, from *this* feed, at *this* URL |
| **Item** | weir collapses Manifestation↔Item (one stored record) |

The grouping is an **overlay, not a merge** — a nullable `work_id` on items, never a
deletion or rewrite — so it *compounds* weir's commitments instead of fighting them:
**never-delete** (no manifestation discarded), **provenance preserved** (each item
keeps its `feed_id`; the archival *respect des fonds* — group across fonds without
erasing origin), **reversible** (ungroup any time). Dedup, done the never-delete way.

**The precision-first staircase.** Five cases, increasing fuzziness; climb only as
far as quality holds, and the fuzzy steps *propose*, they don't decide (§2.1):

1. **Exact id** — already handled (insert dedup).
2. **Resolved-URL identity** — same *resolved* URL (the link resolver already
   unwraps wrappers/shorteners). Deterministic → auto-group.
3. **Near-duplicate text** — **SimHash** (64-bit content fingerprint; Hamming ≤3–4
   bits = same). ~100 lines, zero-dep, computed once at insert + stored; LSH-bucketed
   to scale. Catches verbatim syndication + re-uploads. High precision → auto-group.
4. **Same story, different words** — combine **shared named-entities (from the
   `entity` facet — the catalog feeds the grouping), temporal proximity, title
   Jaccard**. Score → threshold → *propose* (low-confidence, splittable). Never
   auto-collapse on this alone.
5. **Work/Expression links** — identifier bridges (arXiv↔DOI via the biblio
   enricher) + explicit "same work as".

Grouping is **not an LLM call** — a deterministic/statistical **background
reconciliation pass** (so a late-arriving manifestation can still join), idempotent
and reversible. Bias **precision over recall, hard**: a false group (two different
stories merged) is far worse than a missed one. Microblog cold-start (little text →
weak SimHash) → lean on URL/entity, or skip grouping (low syndication risk anyway).

**Data model:** item gains `work_id` (nullable) + `simhash` (u64); a Work is the set
of items sharing `work_id`, carrying a **`confirmed` vs `proposed`** flag (steps 2–3
confirm; step 4 proposes). An optional `/works/<id>.json` records the chosen primary
manifestation (most-complete content, tie-break newest; a source-preference ranking
comes later).

**State semantics — resolved, and the asymmetry *is* the confidence gate:**
- **`read` → Work-level** ("I've seen this story; hide the other sources"), with
  expand to read a specific manifestation. Applies even to *proposed* groups — a
  wrong read-group is cheap and recoverable.
- **`saved` → keeps ALL manifestations of a *confirmed* Work** — link-rot insurance
  at the Work level (one source dies; the saved thing survives in its other copies —
  the never-delete instinct lifted from item to Work). For a *proposed* Work, save
  keeps the manifestation you saw and **offers** the siblings, never sweeps them onto
  the durable shelf on a guess. A wrong save-group is sticky, so it's gated on
  confidence — decides-vs-proposes (§2.1) applied to the save action.

**Staging:** ship steps 2–3 first (deterministic, high-precision — collapses the most
annoying duplication at near-zero false-positive risk); step 4 as a tunable proposal
layer once 2–3 are trusted; step 5 opportunistically. (ROADMAP: LIS adoption arc.)

## 5. The facet scheme **[designed]** — and what weir pre-fills for free

| Facet | Axis | Vocabulary | weir already knows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `domain` | field | controlled | — (LLM) |
| `entity` | thing(s) | controlled, growable | tags (partial) |
| `process` | what's happening | controlled | — (LLM) |
| `method` | how | controlled, growable | — (LLM) |
| `scale` | granularity | enumerated | — (LLM) |
| `spatial` | where | free / gazetteer | — (LLM) |
| `temporal` | when | free / structured | item `published_at` |
| `form` | document genre | enumerated | **item `type`** (article/video/paper/release/…) |
| `provenance` | trust / origin | enumerated | **feed** (source + adapter + health) |

Two commitments: every value is an array; vocabularies are *typed* — some axes
(`scale`, `form`, `provenance`) are closed enumerations, others (`entity`,
`method`) are controlled but **growable** (the cataloger may coin a term, but only
after checking `vocabulary.json` and recording it — growth is auditable, not silent
drift).

**The weir head-start (Stage 0):** `form ← item.type`, `provenance ← feed`,
`temporal ← published_at`, Dublin Core `title/creator/date/identifier/source ←`
item fields, `entity ⊇` existing tags. So a card exists for *every* item with **no
LLM at all** — the language facets (`domain`/`entity`/`process`/`method`/`scale`/
`spatial`) and the abstract are what the cataloger adds (Stage 1).

### 5.1 Facet structure types — and the drilling each affords **[design frame]**

A facet is **not a flat set of values — it is values *plus a relation* between them.**
The relation's *shape* dictates the right drill UI. This is the organizing frame for
the whole "deeper drilling" arc: classify each facet's structure, then build (or
grow) the matching navigator. Five shapes cover the scheme:

| Structure | Relation | Facets | Drill |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nominal** | none (unordered categories) | `form`, `provenance` (and `stance`, mostly) | plain term list — *correct as-is, do not force structure* |
| **Ordinal** | a line / total order | `temporal` (years), `scale` (global>…>personal) | range / slider / roll-up · ✅ temporal year-range shipped |
| **Hierarchical** | containment tree (BT/NT) | `spatial` (geo), `domain` & `entity` once vocab-linked | expand/collapse; select a parent → catch its children |
| **Cyclical** | a wheel | seasonality / month-of-year (derived from `published_at`) | wrap-around range, radial |
| **Associative** | a graph, sideways (RT) | `entity`, `process` relate *across* not *up* | follow-related / co-occurrence |

Two honest caveats this frame must carry:

1. **Structure is *supplied*, not inherent in the strings.** The cataloger hands
   back flat terms; the relations — geo containment (a gazetteer), BT/NT/RT links
   (§7), the ordinal scales — are a **separate layer built on top.** That layer *is*
   the thesaurus. So "a facet gains organization" = growing its relations, one facet
   at a time, each with the structure type that fits. It is earned, not free (hence
   spatial is real work, not a flag flip).
2. **Some facets are legitimately flat, and should stay so.** `form`/`provenance`
   are true nominal categories; imposing a hierarchy is over-engineering. The skill
   is *matching* the drill to the actual structure, never imposing one model. (Even
   nominal facets can hide a relation — `stance` has a latent sentiment ordinal,
   critical→neutral→appreciative — worth *noticing*, not worth forcing.)

Note the toolkit is broader than §7 alone: **BT/NT/RT (the thesaurus) covers
hierarchy + association; measurement structure (ordinal, cyclical) covers the
quantitative axes.** Both together are the full structural vocabulary. (See ROADMAP:
structured facets, temporal depth.)

---

## 6. The cataloger — a service, not an agent **[designed]**

A **bounded call** over the deterministic store. Triggered on demand or in batch
(directory-watch-style auto-catalog is a later option). Steps:

1. Read the document (body + the Stage-0 card as `author_hint`).
2. Generate Dublin Core + a structured abstract.
3. Assign the language facets, **checking `vocabulary.json` before coining** any
   new term and recording it if coined.
4. Propose typed `related` edges to existing cards.
5. Emit `confidence`; set `needs_review` when low.
6. Write `/catalog/<glass_id>.json`; stamp the item's `glass_id`.

The cataloger is a **prompt + structured-output schema over an OpenAI-shaped chat
endpoint** — nothing more. Providers (§11): **Ollama (local, default — zero data
egress), nano-gpt, Groq**, all OpenAI-compatible, one client. Output is validated
against the card schema and the vocabulary; on mismatch, retry or `needs_review`.

---

## 7. Controlled vocabulary & thesaurus **[designed]**

Each controlled facet carries the classic LIS relations:

- **BT / NT** — broader / narrower (`ordinary-kriging` NT-of `kriging` BT
  `interpolation`).
- **RT** — related (`variogram` RT `kriging`).
- **UF / USE** — preferred-term redirection (`semivariogram` USE `variogram`).

This solves what embeddings paper over: synonyms collapse to a preferred term,
homonyms disambiguate by facet context, and broaden/narrow is a **graph walk on
declared relations** — cosine may *propose* an edge, but only a ratified declared
relation *decides* (§2.1). Lives in `/schema/vocab/<facet>.json`.

---

## 8. The query side (= weir search v2) **[designed]**

Facet intersection is the native query: *everything that is both
`domain:geostatistics` and `entity:itabirite`* is a set operation over
`/glass-index/facets/*.json` — fast, deterministic, no model. On top:

- **Broaden** a zero-result query → climb BT, drop a facet, switch axes.
- **Narrow** a fifty-result query → descend NT, intersect another facet.
- **Follow chains** → traverse `relations.json` typed edges.

These are the reference-interview moves. They are *plain functions*; an LLM
performs them only when you want natural-language search ("videos about kriging
from this month") — and even then it just *chooses* facet constraints, it doesn't
do the retrieval. **This subsumes weir's planned full-text search v2:** glass
search is LIS-shaped (faceted + thesaurus), with full-text (librarian v2, when it
lands) as one more deterministic index alongside the facet indexes.

---

## 9. Notes — first-class, as items **[designed]**

A note is **an item whose feed is you**: `type: 'note'` (→ `form: note`), a
**markdown** body, authored not fetched. It flows through the exact machinery
items already use — stored in the VFS, never-deleted, FSA-mounted, searched, and
**cataloged by the same service.** Your fleeting thoughts get faceted and filed
for free. Markdown (not Auditable cells — weir isn't Auditable-based): universal,
FSA-friendly, glass-compatible; the catalog *card* carries the structure, the body
stays plain. **Annotations** (a note bound to a specific item) are a second step.

---

## 10. The knowledge graph — emergent, not an engine **[designed]**

There is no graph database. The graph is three things that fall out of a good
catalog: (1) **facet intersection** (everything sharing a facet value is
connected — free, from the indexes), (2) **typed `related` edges** (the cataloger —
or a similarity signal — *proposes*; you *ratify*; only then is it an edge, §2.1),
(3) **the thesaurus** (the vocabulary graph). Statistical lenses are welcome *over*
this substance, never *as* it: **clustering** over facet co-occurrence to find
neighborhoods, **UMAP** (on facet vectors — no embedding model needed) to draw a
similarity *terrain*, a **force-directed** layout to render explicit relations.
They visualize and suggest; they cast no vote on what is filed where. Build the
catalog well; the graph is what it gives back.

---

## 11. LLM providers & keys **[settled direction]**

Vendor patchbay's pattern (`../etc/patchbay/401/src/{providers,vault}.js`):

- **providers** — `ollama` (local), `nanogpt`, `groq`, `custom`: all OpenAI
  chat-completions-shaped, one client, fallback model lists.
- **vault** — keys in **OPFS, encrypted PBKDF2→AES-GCM** behind an optional
  passphrase. Never localStorage, never in the catalog. **Ollama needs no key and
  ships zero data off-device — the ethos-pure default.** Cloud providers are
  opt-in, per-action, and *visible* (flight-deck: you see when data leaves).

---

## 12. Identifiers **[settled]**

`glass_id = glass-YYYYMMDD-NNN` — catalog date + daily sequence. Human-sortable,
collision-free per day, carries a weak temporal hint without pretending to be a
UUID. (weir's stable item id remains the `document_ref`.)

---

## 13. Relationship to weir & the GCU stack

- weir's **`type`** → glass **`form`**; **feed/health** → **`provenance`**;
  **tags** → seed **`entity`**; **routing rules** → a deterministic proto-cataloger
  that can pre-assign facets at insert.
- **webmcp** sits *on top* as the trigger/query layer — your Claude can say
  "catalog these 40," "re-facet the geostatistics domain," "find me X" — driving
  the librarian without the core being agentic.
- An **Auditable-based glass** could be a second implementation of this format
  (notebook-shaped); the two stay interoperable through the catalog card. weir's
  store and a `glass/` tree can share one FSA folder.
- **Prior art:** the user's *Holocene* (~2,500 links/books/papers with trust tiers
  + LLM enrichment) is structurally this system already; its trust tiers seed the
  `provenance` vocabulary, and its archive is a future backfill target for the
  cataloger.

---

## 14. Build stages

Each stage is useful alone; stop at any prefix.

- **Stage 0 — format, no AI.** Facet schema + the card format + a deterministic
  builder that emits `/catalog/<glass_id>.json` from metadata weir already has
  (`form←type`, `provenance←feed`, Dublin Core, tags→entity). A "catalog" view to
  *see* the corpus faceted. Proves the format on the real corpus, commits nothing
  irreversible. **← building now.**
- **Stage 1 — the cataloger service.** Vendor providers + vault; Ollama-first
  bounded call fills the language facets + proposes `related` edges; opt-in,
  per-item or batch, `confidence`/`needs_review` review queue.
- **Stage 2 — the query side.** Facet-intersection + thesaurus broaden/narrow
  (weir's search v2, LIS-shaped); the implicit graph becomes navigable.
- **Stage 3 — notes & graph view.** Notes-as-items + annotations; the optional
  force-graph view; webmcp triggers.

---

## 15. Open questions

1. **Identity.** This turns weir from a small reader into a self-cataloging
   knowledge base. Deliberate, but it drops the "small surface" virtue. Accepted
   in principle; revisit if the surface gets unwieldy.
2. **Auto-catalog trigger.** On-insert (every item) vs. on-save (only items you
   keep) vs. explicit/batch. Lean: **on-keep + batch** — don't LLM-process the
   whole firehose; catalog what you decide matters. Stage 0 cards exist for all;
   the *LLM* pass is selective.
3. **Provenance vocabulary.** The exact closed `provenance` set (seeded from
   Holocene tiers, never yet frozen).
4. **Index persistence.** weir's in-memory query index already exists; do the
   glass facet indexes persist to `/glass-index/` or rebuild in memory at hydrate?
   (Lean: in-memory like the item index, persist later if boot cost bites.)
5. **Vocabulary bootstrapping.** Cold-start the controlled vocabularies (seed from
   the user's domains) vs. grow purely from the corpus.

---

## 16. Authority data — sources, tiers & the build-time-extract pattern **[reference]**

Sourcing for the LIS arc's gazetteer + named-entity authority (§7, ROADMAP).
**"Local" is three tiers:** (1) **vendored in the single file** (KB — only
curated/extracted subsets); (2) a **local data pack** in the FSA/OPFS store
(MB–GB, downloaded once, queried offline — *separate from the shipped artifact*,
like the catalog); (3) **API-only** (the full GB–TB sources — query on demand or
extract at build time).

| Source | Covers | Scale | License | Local tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wikidata** ⭐ | everything; the cross-ID hub | ~110M items | **CC0** | subset (full ~100 GB+) |
| **GeoNames** | places + containment | ~12M | **CC-BY** | `cities15000` ~5 MB / subset |
| **CIA World Factbook** | 254 countries: `region`, `capital`, coords | 254 | **CC0** | **already packed — `../gcu-library`** |
| **Getty TGN** | hierarchical gazetteer | ~4M | ODC-BY | subset / API |
| **LCSH** | subjects (BT/NT) | ~430k | **public domain** | trimmed pack |
| **LCNAF / VIAF** | names | ~10M / ~30M | PD / ODC-BY | subset / API |
| **ORCID** | researchers | ~20M | **CC0** | subset / API |
| **MeSH / AGROVOC** | medical / agriculture | ~30k / ~40k | PD / CC-BY | pack |
| ~~**DDC**~~ | classification | — | ⛔ proprietary (OCLC) | — |
| ~~**GeoRef**~~ | geoscience thesaurus | — | ⛔ subscription (AGI) | — |

*(Sizes/licenses are ballparks — verify VIAF/ISNI terms before relying.)*

**Licensing is the real gate, not size.** CC0 (Wikidata, ORCID, CIA Factbook) and
US-gov public-domain (LCSH/LCNAF/MeSH) are freely embeddable; CC-BY / ODC-BY
(GeoNames, Getty, AGROVOC, VIAF) just need an attributions note (we already carry
one for fonts). **DDC and GeoRef are paywalled — route around them** (glass already
treats DDC as display-only, never the organizing system; the CC0/PD sources cover
the need).

**The pattern that dissolves size: build-time extraction keyed to the corpus.** You
never resolve *the world* — you resolve *what weir holds* (~15k `entity` terms, ~640
`spatial` terms). Look each up once against an open API, keep label + cross-IDs + the
BT/NT or containment chain, **vendor the small result.** The full source is a
build-time *input*, never a runtime dependency — the gazetteer pattern, generalized.

**The GCU already provides tier 2 — and the gazetteer's backbone.** `../gcu-library`
is a registry of CC0/PD **data packs** (`.gcudat` + sha256 integrity + `std.data("…")`
access) — *exactly* the local-data-pack mechanism, same org. It already ships the
**CIA World Factbook** pack (CC0): **254 countries with `region` (continent grouping),
`capital`, and coordinates** — i.e. the *country→region* and *capital→country*
containment edges, **the upper tiers of the spatial gazetteer, already local.** So:

> **gazetteer = factbook pack** (countries / regions / capitals — free, local, sibling
> repo) **+ a build-time GeoNames/Wikidata extract for the city long-tail +
> sub-national** (US states, provinces, non-capital cities — the bulk of weir's actual
> ~640 spatial terms, which the factbook's country/capital set doesn't reach).

weir starts the gazetteer from a sibling pack, not from zero. (The library's **book**
packs likewise feed the Stage-4 holdings shelf.) **Pick two for the tail:** **Wikidata**
(CC0, universal, carries every other authority's cross-ref ID) + **GeoNames** (CC-BY,
the containment graph) — both open APIs, both build-time-extractable.

The neo-dadaist throughline holds: zero-dependency, single-file, browser-as-runtime,
local-first, auditable by construction, never-delete. Glass is that ethos applied
to **memory itself** — a knowledge base whose every classification decision is
inspectable and reversible, and (with Ollama) one whose intelligence never leaves
your machine.
